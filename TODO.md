# Future work

- validate apply clues ad nauseum tests

- Add to Sect games site
- Add more scenarios

- Put in app store
- Add error boundaries? handle error for unknown action in reducer
- consider consolidating duplicate code around `matrixColumnInfo,matrixRowInfo` in `generatePuzzle` and `generateSolutionMatrix`

## Maybe later

- Could add more clues?
  - the red house has an even number of trees (this is a glorified "or")
  - the red house has more than 3 trees (this is a glorified "or")
  - the red house does not have the most or fewest trees (this is a glorified "or")
